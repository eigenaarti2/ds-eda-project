But it is also one of the most important steps of the data science lifecycle since it determines the quality of your data. Remember the \"garbage in, garbage out\" concept! Therefore it has a huge impact on your prediction model later on and is time well spent. Most of the data you will see in this course is already pretty much cleaned up for modelling.

    "Missing Data and Imputing are big topics in data science. Imputing means to replace missing values with sensible values. There are several imputing techniques that we will familiarize ourselves with in this notebook. When you impute missing values, you are manipulating the data and this can have a significant impact on the quality of the data.  Hence you need to have a certain level of knowledge about your data in order to find a good solution and the approach that is best suited for the task at hand. As usual in data science, there is no one solution that fits all problems. Imputation of data ranges from fairly simple to highly complex strategies. Remember that the work of a data scientist progresses in cycles. It is always best to start with a simple approach and become more complex with each cycle. With this in mind, your pre-processing will only become more complex and thus more time-consuming if it really provides more value.\n",
